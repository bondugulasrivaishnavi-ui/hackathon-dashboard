# Hackathon Dashboard

An automated platform that aggregates hackathons from multiple sources and displays them on a single dashboard within 24 hours of posting.

## 🚀 Problem
Students miss hackathons because announcements are scattered across multiple platforms like Unstop, Devfolio, LinkedIn, and college groups.

## 💡 Solution
This project automatically collects hackathon data from trusted sources and shows:
- Newly posted hackathons (last 24 hours)
- Upcoming hackathons (this month / next 2 months)
- Direct source links for full details

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
